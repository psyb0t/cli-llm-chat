- `HF_TOKEN`: Get an API key at https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens

- `MAX_NEW_TOKENS`: Control the verbal diarrhea (default: 256)
- `TOP_P`: Fiddle with randomness, you mad scientist (default: 0.95)

- `DEBUG`: Want to see the chaos under the hood? (default: false)
- `DEVICE`: CUDA or CPU? Choose your weapon.

For Telegram support, you'll need these additional environment variables:

- `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`: Your Telegram bot token (get it from @BotFather)
- `TELEGRAM_BOT_USER_DATA_FILE`: Path to store user data (e.g., "/path/to/user_data.json")
- `TELEGRAM_BOT_SUPERUSER_CHAT_ID`: Chat ID of the superuser (optional, but recommended for ultimate power)
- `TELEGRAM_BOT_SPLIT_RESPONSE_NEWLINES`: Whether to split responses by newlines and spam the suckers (default: false)

Example:

```bash
export MODEL_NAME="NousResearch/Nous-Hermes-Llama2-13b"
export TEMPERATURE=0.9
export MAX_NEW_TOKENS=512
export DEBUG=true
export TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="your_telegram_bot_token_here"
export TELEGRAM_BOT_USER_DATA_FILE="/path/to/user_data.json"
