## 🚀 Features (or Whatever the Hell You Wanna Call 'Em)

- **No GUI BS**: We don't need no stinkin' graphical interfaces. Real hackers type!
- **LLM on Steroids**: It's like giving a microphone to a schizophrenic AI at a death metal concert.
- **Customizable AF**: Tweak it, break it, make it scream. It's your dystopian playground!
- **System Message Mayhem**: Convince the AI it's a drunk pirate or an alien stripper. Sky's the limit, baby!
- **History Management**: Because even digital chaos needs a paper trail.
